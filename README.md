# Assemblers
Makeathon 2024 Project [Team name = Assemblers]

Collaborated with my team to create a user-friendly web application (we actually presented our project to the judges as a terminal application because we didnt have enough time to integrate it as a whole) which leverages AI to automate information retrieval. Instead of manual searches, the AI processes data from various websites or our own sources, categorizing it into chunks with similar information and storing it in a database. Users can input questions, and the AI retrieves, vectorizes, and matches the most relevant content, delivering precise answers.
